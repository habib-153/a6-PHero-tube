        <!-- Question 1 -->
          <p class="text-xl font-medium text-[#171717]"><span>Q1. </span>Discuss the scope of var, let, and const.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-[#171717a9]"><span class="font-medium">Ans. </span>Var, let, const these are used to declare a variable in js. var is global, we can access it from everywhere but old. let and const are used highly now.The difference between let and const is that we can reassign the value of let but can not reassign the value of const.</p>

          <!-- Question 2 -->
          <p class="text-xl mt-4 font-medium text-[#171717]"><span>Q2. </span>Tell us the use cases of null and undefined.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-[#171717a9]"><span class="font-medium">Ans. </span>Null and undefined are two special values in JavaScript that represent the absence of a meaningful value. They are often used to indicate that a variable has not been assigned a value yet, or that a function does not return anything. </p>

          <!-- Question 3 -->
          <p class="text-xl mt-4 font-medium text-[#171717]"><span>Q3. </span>What do you mean by REST API?</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-[#171717a9]"><span class="font-medium">Ans. </span>A REST API is an application programming interface that follows the principles of representational state transfer (REST). It allows different applications to communicate with each other over the internet using standard methods such as HTTP. A REST API exposes resources that can be accessed and manipulated by clients using HTTP verbs such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. For example, a REST API for a blog site might have a resource called /posts that represents all the blog posts on the site. A client can use the GET verb to request a list of posts, or use the POST verb to create a new post.</p>
